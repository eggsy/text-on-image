# Text on Image

<p align="center">
  <img src="./banner.png" alt="banner" />
</p>

A simple tool that writes text on any image based on X and Y coordinates, it can also combine images into one single PDF file.

## How to Use

- Clone the repository.
- Install dependencies via yarn: `yarn`
- For a test ride, run: `yarn test`
- Configure the options based on your preferences in `config.example.ts` and rename it to `config.ts`
- For an actual use, replace the image, coordinates, file name and other settings in config and build the app via: `yarn build && yarn start`

## The Story

We had to find a way to create tens of tickets for our theater play at the university. We thought writing by hand would take so much time and I decided to create an app for it.

This app was very basic at first, but I polished it to publish it on GitHub.
